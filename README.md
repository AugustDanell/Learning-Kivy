# learning-kivy
A repo designed for learning and maintaining knowledge in the kiwy library for Python. Kivy is a library that is used to develop for instance mobile applications. Much like the library pygame one can use it to write games as well (See pygame repo).

- text_game.py: A small text game where the player plays by pressing different buttons. The goal of the game is to avoid the bear and to collect the blueberries.
